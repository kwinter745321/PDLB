# README.md - v1.0.1

There is a text README file inside the zip that gives simple instructions.
The kit can be installed anywhere, and then you should update Windows ENV Variables PATH to include the bin folder of the kit.

The PDLB program needs a Worksheet Folder (which it asks.)  Also,
suggest you create a New Project (which creates a subfolder.) But it
also creates an images folder, etc.

you can post issues or send me an email: aiy745321@gmail.com
