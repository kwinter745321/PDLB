# README.md - CheckBoxDisplay

There are three files provided for this video.
The demonstration depicts a frame with three CheckBoxes and
a DisplayBox. The 'msg$' 'utput is placed into the  DisplayBox.

The computatons are performed using a simple function
that are provided in the code file.

Source
- CheckBoxDisplay.src (Saved source file.)
- CheckBoxDisplayCode.txt

Output
- CheckBoxDisplay.bas (merged control code and programming code file.)

The bas file can be loaded directly into the PicoMite.
But I find it easier to use the AddOn to load it into MMEdit5
which uses the MMControl Center program (these are available from the
PicoMite site.)
