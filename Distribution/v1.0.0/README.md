# README.md - v1.0.0

There is a text README file inside the zip that gives simple instructions.
The kit can be installed anywhere, and then you should update Windows ENV Variables PATH to include the bin folder of the kit.

The PDLB program needs a Worksheet Folder (which it asks.)  Also,
suggest you create a New Project (which creates a subfolder.) But it
also creates an images folder, etc.

# Wiring for InfoTwoPage program

Connect connection "dupont" wires between Pico pins and the onboard headers
as follows:

| Pico Pin | Header & Pin |
| -------- | ------------ |
| GP17     | Button 1 |
| GP21     | Button 2 |
| GP26     | Potentiometer |
| GP27     | LED 1 |
| GP28     | LED 2 |

# Update 24 September 2024

Please use the Examples.zip as I made several minor changes to the
code files to simplify and improve the actions in the demo program.
