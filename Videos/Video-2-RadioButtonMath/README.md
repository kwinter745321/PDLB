# README.md - Video 2 RadioButtonMath

There are three files provided for this video.
The demonstration depicts two NumberBoxes and a Frame
surrounding two Radio buttons (that allow user to choose math operation).
The output is placed into a DisplayBox.

The computatons are performed using three MMBasic Functions
that are provided in the code file.

Source
- RadioButtonMath.src (Saved source file.)
R- adioButtonMathCode.txt

Output
- RadioButtonMath.bas (merged control code and programming code file.)

The bas file can be loaded directly into the PicoMite.
But I find it easier to use the AddOn to load it into MMEdit5
which uses the MMControl Center program (these are available from the
PicoMite site.)
